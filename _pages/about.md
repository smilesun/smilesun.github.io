With transdisciplinary expertise in statistics, software engineering, (multi-objective) optimization and control theory, my research perspective lies in experimental design, data driven control and sequential decision making for precision medicine and robotics applications. 
  
To achieve this, I have dipped into the following research activities:

- Data driven decision and control
  - Multi-objective feedback optimization and adaptive control with uncertain plant models (e.g. deep neural networks) [M-HOF-Opt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13728.pdf)
  - Multi-level optimization with hypothesis posterior for continual-discrete hybrid space optimization using RL and Bayesian Optimization [ReinBo](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
  - Optimal path learning for multi-parameter persistence homology (Toplogical Data Analysis) [persistence homology learning](https://github.com/smilesun/multi_parameter_persistence_homology_path_learning)
  - Understanding inference for control with Probabilistic Graphical Model [Tutorial Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003114)
  - Exploration in reinforcement learning with sparse reward [maxEntropy](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhao19d/zhao19d.pdf), [ReinBo](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
  - High dimensional Robust Model Predicative Control [tubeMPC](https://github.com/smilesun/tube_mpc)

  - Causal and variational inference based domain generalization for deep learning [HDUVA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09436.pdf)
  - Multi-objective Bayesian optimization for distributed model selection under domain shift [RFMS](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29516-5_48)
  - Bayesian neural network does not generalize [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02972.pdf)
  - Ancestral data synthesis for approximate causal discover and abstraction with hidden confounders [causalSpyne](https://github.com/marrlab/causalspyne)

- Learning sequential data and identification of dynamic systems
  - Learning based non-linear observer design for dynamic systems [kkl observer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01476.pdf)
  - Learning Opinion dynamics [IFAC paper](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/papers/network_ifac23xing.pdf)
  - Port-Hamiltonian modeling, learning and controlÂ (e.g. bio-chemical reaction networks)
  - Generalized Additive Model for Functional Data Analysis [mlrFDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07511.pdf)

For more research activities, see [my google scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FnWKUqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am also an open source software developer (R, python, cpp, java) for machine learning and reinforcement learning [see my github](https://github.com/smilesun).
 
Since 2021, I have been a continuous reviewer for AI conferences like ICML, ICLR, NeuroIPS.

For system, optimization and control theory, I am trained in 
  - formal method, nonlinear control
  - nonlinear contraint optimization, LMI
  - networked optimization and control, opinion dynamics
  - model predictive control
  - power system optimization and control
  - infinite dimensional control (PDE)
  - (soft) robotics
  
I value the role of algebraic statistics and differential geometry in my research 

During my free time, I like exploring the nature with friends, enjoy various sports (e.g. table tennis, badminton, swimming, entry level martial arts).
