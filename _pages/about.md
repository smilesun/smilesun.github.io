With transdisciplinary expertise in statistics, software engineering, optimization and control theory, my research perspective lie in experimental design, data driven control and sequential decision making for precision medicine and robotics applications. 
  
To achieve this, I have dipped into the following research activities:

- Port-Hamiltonian modeling, learning and controlÂ (e.g. bio-chemical reaction networks)
- High dimensional approximate causal discover, causal discovery with hidden confounders
- Multi-parameter persistence homology for Toplogical Data Analysis [persistence homology learning](https://github.com/smilesun/multi_parameter_persistence_homology_path_learning)
- Multi-objective feedback optimization and adaptive control with uncertain plant models (e.g. deep neural networks) [M-HOF-Opt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13728.pdf)
- Open source modular software design for domain generalization and multi-modal deep learning [DomainLab](https://github.com/marrlab/DomainLab)
- Robust Model Predicative Control [tubeMPC](https://github.com/smilesun/tube_mpc)
- Learning based non-linear observer design for dynamic systems [kkl observer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01476.pdf)
- Opinion dynamics [opinion dynamics](https://people.kth.se/~kallej/papers/network_ifac23xing.pdf)
- Inference for control with probabilistic graphical model [e.g. paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003114)
- Causal and variational inference based domain generalization for deep learning [hduva](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09436.pdf)
- Exploration in reinforcement learning [maxEntropy](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhao19d/zhao19d.pdf), [reinbo](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
- Reinforcement learning on heterogeneous graph, multi-level optimization [reinbo](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
- Generalized Additive Model for Functional Data Analysis [mlrFDA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07511.pdf)

For more research activities, see [my google scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FnWKUqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am also an open source software developer (R, python, cpp, java) for machine learning and reinforcement learning [see my github](https://github.com/smilesun).
 
Since 2021, I have been a continuous reviewer for AI conferences like ICML, ICLR, NeuroIPS.

For system, optimization and control theory, I am trained in 
  - formal method, nonlinear control
  - nonlinear contraint optimization, LMI
  - networked optimization and control, opinion dynamics
  - model predictive control
  - power system optimization and control
  - infinite dimensional control (PDE)
  - (soft) robotics
  
I value the role of algebraic statistics and differential geometry in my research 

During my free time, I like exploring the nature with friends, enjoy various sports (e.g. table tennis, badminton, swimming, entry level martial arts).
