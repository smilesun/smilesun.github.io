With expertise in statistics (causality), software engineering, optimization and control theory, my research goal is to bridge the above different disciplines for precision medicine. To achieve this, I have dipped into the following:

- Toplogical data analysis 
- Model predicative control 
- Inference for control with probabilistic graphical model [e.g. paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003114)
- Causal and variational inference based domain generalization for deep learning [e.g. paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09436.pdf)
- Exploration in reinforcement learning [e.g. paper link](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhao19d/zhao19d.pdf)
- Reinforcement learning on heterogeneous graph, multi-level optimization [e.g. paper link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
- Feedback optimization and adaptive control with uncertain plant models (on going)
- Learning based non-linear observer design for dynamic systems [e.g. paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.01476.pdf)
- Port-Hamiltonian modeling, learning and controlÂ (e.g. bio-chemical reaction networks)
- Generalized Additive Model for Functional Data Analysis [e.g. paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07511.pdf)

For more research activities, see [my google scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=FnWKUqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

I am also an open source software developer (R, python, cpp, java) for machine learning and reinforcement learning [see my github](https://github.com/smilesun), and a continuous reviewer for AI conferences like ICML, ICLR, NeuroIPS.

I value the role of algebraic statistics and differential geometry in my research and I have knowledge in formal method, network and model predicative control.

During my free time, I like exploring the nature with friends, enjoy various sports (e.g. table tennis, badminton, swimming, entry level martial arts).
