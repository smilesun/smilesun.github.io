My research interest is in the intersection of causal inference and discovery, reinforcement learning and control theory. 


- Inference for control with probabilistic graphical model
- Causal inference based domain generalization and adaptation
- Optimal experimental design and exploration in reinforcement learning
- Reinforcement learning on graph
- Feedback optimization and adaptive control (Simultaneous system identification and control)
- Port-Hamiltonian modeling and control of biochemical reaction networks
- Non-linear observer design
 
I am also an open source software developer for (deep) machine learning and reinforcement learning.
