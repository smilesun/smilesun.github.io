My research interest is in the intersection of causal inference and discovery, reinforcement learning, optimization and control theory, statistical modeling and signal processing. 


- Inference for control with probabilistic graphical model [e.g. paper link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9003114)
- Causal inference based domain generalization and adaptation for deep learning [e.g. paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09436.pdf)
- Optimal experimental design and exploration in reinforcement learning, optimization [e.g. paper link](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/zhao19d/zhao19d.pdf)
- Reinforcement learning on heterogenous graph, multi-level optimization as hybrid handit [e.g. paper link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-43823-4_7)
- Feedback optimization and adaptive control with uncertain plant models
- Non-linear observer design for dynamic systems, learning of dynamic system
- Port-Hamiltonian modeling, learning and control (e.g. biochemical reaction networks)
- Generalized Additive Model for Functional Data Analysis [e.g. paper link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07511.pdf)
 
I am also an open source software developer for (deep) machine learning and reinforcement learning [e.g. my github profile](https://github.com/smilesun)[pub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016794731930194X)[pub](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07511.pdf)[pub](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/paradox/index.html), and a reviewer for top AI conferences like ICML, ICLR, NeuroIPS.
I value the role of algebraic statistics and differential geometry in my research.

During my free time, I like exploring the nature, enjoy various sports (e.g. swimming, entry level martial arts).
